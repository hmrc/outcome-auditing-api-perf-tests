# outcome-auditing-api-perf-tests

Performance test suite for the `outcome-auditing`, using [performance-test-runner](https://github.com/hmrc/performance-test-runner) under the hood.

## Pre-requisites

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:

* Installed/configured service manager

### Services
Run the following commands to start services locally:

    sm --start OUTCOME_AUDITING --appendArgs '{
        "OUTCOME_AUDITING": [
            "-J-Dauditing.consumer.baseUri.port=6001",
            "-J-Dauditing.consumer.baseUri.host=localhost",
            "-J-Dauditing.enabled=true"
        ]
    }'
### Logging

The default log level for all HTTP requests is set to `WARN`. Configure [logback.xml](src/test/resources/logback.xml) to update this if required.

### WARNING :warning:

Do **NOT** run a full performance test against staging from your local machine. Please [implement a new performance test job](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/DTRG/Practical+guide+to+performance+testing+a+digital+service#Practicalguidetoperformancetestingadigitalservice-SettingupabuildonJenkinstorunagainsttheStagingenvironment) and execute your job from the dashboard in [Performance Jenkins](https://performance.tools.staging.tax.service.gov.uk).

## Tests

Run smoke test (locally) as follows:

```bash
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=true gatling:test
```

Run full performance test (locally) as follows:

```bash
sbt -DrunLocal=true gatling:test
```

Run smoke test (staging) as follows:

```bash
sbt -Dperftest.runSmokeTest=true -DrunLocal=false gatling:test
```

## Scalafmt

Check all project files are formatted as expected as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtCheck
```

Format `*.sbt` and `project/*.scala` files as follows:
